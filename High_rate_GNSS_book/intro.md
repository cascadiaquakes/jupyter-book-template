# Welcome to the high rate GNSS processing book

## Project overview
The only GNSS high rate position product available is the one offered by UNR, 5 minutes sampling rate. The main motivation for this project was to have our own processing to be able to compare and have full control around the different steps. We are looking at sub-daily events using SSEs in the Cascadia region. We chose the PRIDE PPP ar software for it's opensource and state-of-the-art precision.

This book features the different notebooks displaying the functions necessary to process GNSS data using the PRIDE software.  
For production, go to the conclusion and look at the script that encapsulates all the different steps, allowing efficient parallel processing.
